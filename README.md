# WordleSolver
The start of my Python project to give word suggestions to help solve Wordle puzzles. Here it is entirely console based, but you can play the web-version the I created with HTML, CSS, and Typescript on my website [here](https://elodinlaarz.github.io/wordlHelpr.html)

# WordlBattl
In addition to this helper, I have also expanded the project to include a competetive version against a computer, WordlBattl, which can be found [here](https://elodinlaarz.github.io/wordlBattl.html).
